# Tutorial: Styling the content of your website with Bootstrap
After structuring the content of your website using HTML, you are ready to start styling it using CSS.

We will use a CSS framework called [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), one of the most popular frameworks for styling websites. 
We will use Bootstrap for two reasons:
1. Bootstrap makes it faster to style a webpage
2. Bootstrap allows you to build responsive websites and applications

In this tutorial, you will find several links to [Bootstrap official documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) in each task. This tutorial's main purpose is to familiarize yourself with the Bootstrap documentation and apply Bootstrap main CSS classes to style your website.

Before proceeding, download the version of the [website](https://github.com/josecarlosgt/Web-Design-and-Development/tree/tutorial-2-designing-and-structuring-content) created in the previous tutorial containing the structure and images. In this tutorial, we will apply Bootstrap styling rules to the index.html file.

## Part I: Basic Bootstrap 

## Task 1: Installing Bootstrap
Reference: [Bootstrap Docs > Introduction](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)

The easiest way to add Bootstrap to your website is using the content delivery network (CDN) servers recommended by Boostrap. More sophisticated ways of using Bootstrap require downloading the source files, which allows higher customization.

We will use the CDN resources:
- Include the CSS resource into the \<head\> element
- Include the JavaScript resource right before the closing </body> tag
- You also need to include a [responsive meta tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) which ensures proper rendering of your webpage on mobile devices. This is necessary because Bootstrap automatically optimizes your code for mobile devices.

Put it all together and your webpage should look like this:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
    ...
       
        <!-- Responsive metatag -->    
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

        <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous">

    ...
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Bootstrap JavaScript -->
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        
        ...
  </body>
</html>       
```

## Task 2: Styling text content

### Reboot: [Bootstrap Docs > Content > Reboot](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/reboot/)

When you start using Bootstrap out of the box, it applies a reboot of the default browser styles. This means Bootstrap strips out all the default styles like margin, padding, font styles, and size, replacing them with a clean and basic set of default Bootstrap styles. The purpose of this reboot is to provide you with a simple baseline to build upon the style of your website that is consistent across browsers.  

### Typography: [Bootstrap Docs > Content > Typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/typography/)

Bootstrap also provides several features for styling text content that allow you to create customized headings, paragraphs, and lists.

The feature [display headings](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/typography/#display-headings) allows you to display your headings in a larger, slightly more prominent style.

Add "display-2" to h1, "display-5" to h2, and "display-6" to h3 elements:

```html
<h1 class="display-1">...</h1>
<h2 class="display-5">...</h2>
<h3 class="display-6">...</h3>
```
> Note the display headings classes use a numbering independent of the HTML heading elements. The display headings classes can be used with any HTML element.

The feature [lead](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/typography/#lead) allows you to make paragraphs stand out. We can use this feature for the first paragraph on our website to make it look slightly bigger and relevant than the rest of the paragraphs:

```html
<p class="lead">
    Laguna Brava is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst">karstic lake</a> of incomparable beauty
    located in western Guatemala. Laguna Brava is located in a remote and highly underdeveloped region, so
    reaching and exploring the lake takes a mix of extreme adventure and intimate contact with nature. The
    lake beauty lies in the colours variety of its waters, which depends on the sun's position. Laguna Brava
    is also known as Yolnabaj by the region's inhabitants, which translates as "rough lake". Despite its
    name, the waters of Laguna Brava Laguna are so calm that they instantly awaken a deep feeling of peace.
</p>
```

Use the [unstyled lists](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/typography/#lists) feature to remove the decoration and margin of list items:
```html
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>Duration: 5 hours approx.</li>
    <li>Price: $50 USD</li>
    <li>Minimum: 2 pax</li>
</ul>
```

## Task 3: Styling images content

Reference: [Bootstrap Docs > Content > Images](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/images/)

Images in Bootstrap are made responsive with the *.img-fluid* class. Add this class to the three images in the website:

```html    
<img src="img/panoramic-laguna-brava-2.jpg" class="img-fluid" ...>
...
```

Notes:
- Adding responsive behavior usually involves adjusting the [max-width](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_max-width.asp) CSS property of HTML elements. This property defines the maximum width of an element's content and it prevents the element from becoming larger than the value specified by max-width.
- img-fluid maintains a 100% max-width regardless of the size of the screen, so images never become larger than their parent elements (containers). As a result, images are resized to fit the screen.
 

## Task 4: Class utilities for text

### Text: [Bootstrap Docs > Utilities > Text](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/text/)

Bootstrap provides common text utilities to control weight, alignment, and other aspects.

Using [font weight](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/text/#font-weight-and-italics) classes, control the style of the labels on the guided visits options:

```html
<span class="fw-bold">Duration: </span>...</li>
<span class="fw-bold">Price: </span>...</li>
<span class="fw-bold">Minimum: </span>...</li>
```

Using [text decoration](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/text/#text-decoration) classes, adjust the style of the safety statement on the introductory text to the guided visits:

```html
<strong class="text-decoration-underline fw-normal">they provide life vests and local guides who know the lake very well to take care of your safety.</strong>
 ```

Using [text alignment](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/text/#text-alignment) classes, center the main heading and the headings in guided visits sections:

```html
<h1 class="display-1 text-center">...</h1>
<h3 class="display-6 text-center">...</h3>
```
Notes:
- Text alignment classes also include *text-start* for aligning text to the left and *text-end* for aligning text to the right. 

## Task 5: Class utilities for borders

Reference: [Bootstrap Docs > Utilities > Borders](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/borders/)

Many of these utility classes for styling content follow conventions on how to refer to the sides of HTML elements. For example,
- *start* refers to left
- *end* refers to right
- *top* and *bottom* remain the same

These terms act as suffixes in several classes that control style aspects such as borders, alignment, and spacing, as you will see below.

Give a border to each article:

```html
<article class="border border-secondary border-2" >
```

[Border-radius](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/borders/#border-radius) classes in Bootstrap allow you to modify the border-radius property. [border-radius](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp) is a CSS property that defines the radius of an element's corners. Round the corner of the guided visits images: 

```html
<img src="img/kayak.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded-pill" ...>
```

> This effect gives the images a more natural appearance by eliminating the abrupt pauses that result when lines change direction in sharp corners.

## Task 6: Class utilities for colors

Reference: [Bootstrap Docs > Utilities > Colors](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/colors/)

Color utilities include predefined classes to colorize text. Adjust the color and font weight of the warning statement in the first guided visit option:

```html
<strong class="text-warning fw-bold">This guided visit is physically demanding, and we recommend it for only those in excellent physical condition.</strong>
```

Bootstrap enables more comprehensive customization for working with colors. For now, we will use the default [color system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/color/). You can also use this system for defining [background colors](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/) of any HTML element.

## Task 7: Class utilities for spacing

Reference: [Bootstrap Docs > Utilities > Spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/)

Spacing utilities provide a [notation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/#notation) to specify a wide range of shorthand classes related to margin and padding. These shorthand classes follow the syntax {property}{sides}-{size} to set specific values of margin and padding.

Add a gap between the sections following the lead paragraph by adding a vertical margin. Since we want to add a margin to the entire section (title and paragraph), we wrap all the elements in the section in a *div* element that acts as a container. Then, we apply the spacing shorthand class.

Add the *div* container to the "Local Communities" and "Activities" sections:

```html
<section class="my-5">
    <h2 class="display-5">...</h2>
    <p>
        ...
    </p>
</section>
```

Note that *my-5* follows the notation {property}{sides}-{size} where
- {property} is *m* (margin)
- {sides} is *y* (vertical)
- {size} is *4*

## Task 8: Creating buttons

Reference: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/buttons/

Bootstrap includes several predefined button styles. Add a "Book here" button in each guided visit using the *btn* class:

```html
<a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="javascript:void(0)">Book here</a>
```
> This button also specifies color and size.

## Task 9: Adding icons
Reference: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

Finally, try out Bootstrap Icons library for adding icons to your webpage. To use Bootstrap icons library, you need to add the corresponding CSS resource into the \<head\> tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.10.4/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
```

Remember we adjusted the color of the warning statement in the first guided visit option? Add an exclamation icon to increase the attention of the viewer:

```html
<i class="bi-exclamation-triangle"></i>
```
>Icons are also a great way to make your content more accessible for people with color blindness.

Final result:
```html
Cross the four kilometres in a kayak guided by a local guide. <strong class="text-warning fw-bold"><i class="bi-exclamation-triangle"></i> This guided visit is physically demanding, and we recommend it for only those in excellent physical condition.</strong>
```

## Part II: Bootstrap's Layout System 

## Task 10: Creating containers
Reference: [Bootstrap Docs > Layout > Containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/)

Features:
- Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required to use the grid system, which you will use in the next task to arrange your content in rows and columns.
- Containers allow you to wrap your page content and then apply padding around the content.
- They can also center your content on the page in a central column.

Use the default container which sets a fixed width for screen sizes.

```html
<main class="container">
```

### Breakpoints

Bootstrap containers allow you to tailor the content of your webpage to fit a specific screen size. To represent screen sizes, Bootstrap use the concept of breakpoints. [Breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) are the building blocks of responsive design in Bootstrap. Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints:
- Extra Small < 576px
- Small (sm) >= 576px
- Medium (md) >= 768px
- Large (lg) >= 992px
- Extra large (xl) >= 1200px
- Extra extra large   (xxl) >= 1400px

Each breakpoint has a dimension associated that represents a particular viewport or device screen size. The breakpoints serve as a system to specify responsive behavior in HTML elements. For example, if you want to tailor your webpage to be displayed in *large* screens (i.e., 992 pixels width or wider), you can wrap the webpage's content into a *container-lg* class container:

Use containers for the top image and main heading inside the \<header\> element and the main content:
```html
<header>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>...</h1>
        <p>...</p>
    </div>
</header>
<main class="container">
    ...
</main>
```

## Task 11: Adjusting the layout
Reference: [Bootstrap Docs > Layout > Containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/)

[Bootstrap's grid layout system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/) allows you to arrange content in columns and rows following a fully responsive design. The grid layout uses a twelve-column system which means the width of a single column can vary from one to twelve.

This system allows you, for example, to arrange your content three columns of size four each:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      Column
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      Column
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      Column
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

When arranging your content in columns using Bootstrap grid system, you need to use a combination of *col* classes wrapped inside a *row* class container. Furthermore, you can add breakpoints to create a grid system that starts out stacked and becomes horizontal at a given breakpoint.

Use the *col-lg* class to display the content of the website as two columns for large screens (*lg* breakpoint) and as one column for smaller screens:

```html
<section class="my-4 row">
    <article class="col-lg">
        ...
    </article>
    <article class="col-lg">
        ...
    </article>
</div>
```

> The code above specifies the behavior at and over the large (lg) breakpoint, i.e., display the content in two columns when screen size hits the large (lg) breakpoint.

Adjust the spacing between each \<article\> to add gaps both horiontally and vertically using padding (*p*) and margin (*m*) utilities:

Result:
```html
<section class="my-4 row">
    <article class="col-lg my-2 py-2 mx-lg-1 px-2 border border-secondary border-2">
        ...        
    </article>
    <article class="col-lg my-2 py-2 mx-lg-1 px-2 border border-secondary border-2">
        ...
    </article>
</div>
```

> Note that *my* and *py* adjust the vertical margin and padding of each article while *mx* and *px* adjust the horizontal margin and padding, respectively.

## Task 12: Adjusting the form

Adjust the contact form in a two-column grid. The heading and description of the form should be in the first column and the form in the second column. Make the first column narrower than the second column by varying the number of template columns in each column.

```html
<aside class="container">
    <div class="row align-items-center">
        <div class="col-lg-4"> 
            ...
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8"> 
            ...
        </div>
    </div>
</aside>
```

> Note that the content of the first column (heading and form's description) is also vertically centered due to the *align-items-center* class on the row container.

## Task 13: Adjusting the footer

Center the copyright notice on the page's footer:

```html
<footer class="text-center my-5 pt-3 border-top">...</footer>
```

> The [index.html](./index.html) file contains the final HTML document. You can view this webpage in GitHub Pages [here](https://josecarlosgt.github.io/Web-Design-and-Development/).
